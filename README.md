#### *Task No. 1:*

Implement a template class that models an oriented graph

Methods for traversing a graph and finding the shortest:

traversing a graph - DFS\
DFS finding the shortest - Dijkstra's

#### *Task No. 2:*

Suppose a connected graph, where the nodes are trading points. It is necessary to turn one of the trading points into a
warehouse. The price of delivery from the warehouse to the point depends on the distance. Find the optimal point in
terms of maximum cost (i.e. the point for which the maximum distance to any other point is minimal).
